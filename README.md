/*
As an e-commerce company we would like to gauge customer loyalty and satisfaction by asking customers a single question:
"How likely are you to recommend our products / services to a friend or colleague?".
This metric is called NPS which stands for Net Promoter Score.
Respondents answer the question on a scale from 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (extremely likely).
The customerâ€™s order can become eligible for the NPS survey under the following conditions:
i) If the customer has not filled out any NPS survey in the last 90 days.
ii) If no other order from the customer has been eligible for the NPS survey in the last 45 days.
iii) The NPS survey form is sent on the 6th day after all shipments for the order are delivered.
     Example : If all the shipments of an order are delivered on 5th July, the order will become eligible for NPS survey on 11th July.
iv) The customer can fill out the NPS form up to the 45th day from the order date for which the survey form was sent.

	1. On a daily basis, how many customers were eligible to receive the NPS survey form in the month of June?						*/
